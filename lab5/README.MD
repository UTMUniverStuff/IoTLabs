# Communication interfaces

## Scope of the work
Understanding the communication interfaces

## Objectives
  * How to use I2C
  * Interact with sensors via I2C

## Tasks
Using the system implemented in the previous lab, add a way to display data on an LDC16x02 connected via
interface I2C.
Also connect one pressure sensor to the same I2C interface.

All the sensor data should be displayed on the LCD.

## Available materials
  * Arduino Nano v3.0 (Atmega328p)
  * SRD-05VDC
  * 5v electric pump
  * Water level sensors
  * LCD16x02
  * atmospheric pressure sensor

## Theory

### I2C
I2C is a serial protocol that lets multiple low power devices connect to each other, via one two-wire bus.
It is very simple to use.
