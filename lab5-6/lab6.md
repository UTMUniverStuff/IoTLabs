# Communication interfaces

## Scope of the work
Implement and integrate system created in labs 1-4 with IoT Cloud.

## Objectives
  * Interact with baord WEMOS LOLIN ESP32
  * Connect to 802.11 network
  * Uplad data to Cloud

## Tasks
Make your board connect to 802.11 network. Connect sensors and actuators from the previous labs to it. Integrate it with the cloud.

## Available materials
WEMOS LOLIN32 ESP 32, Water level sensor, DTH11 temperature & humidity sensor, relay, pump, wires.

## Implementation

### Schema

### Technical
I used a WiFi library to connect and use 802.11 network. I hardcoded SSID and password of the WiFi strings and just called `WiFi.begin(ssid, password)`. Then I used HTTPClient class to send a http request to the cloud with the data Iâ€™ve collected from the sensors.

## Conclusion

With the scripts implemented in the previous laboratory work, we become independent of the IoT thing. We can just put the device somewhere, connected to electricity and WiFi, and read the required data. Furthermore, we can integrate this data with other applications.
